* My Machine Learning Playground

This repository tracks my educational journey into the realm of 
machine learning, using [[https://www.haskell.org/][Haskell]] as the weapon of choice.

We're going to work through some books, trying to reproduce certain aspects
of the underlying text.

** Goals
- learn
- explore the space of related libraries in the Haskell ecosystem
- represent common algorithms in Haskell
- find some abstractions to create a somewhat unified way of representing
  different algorithms and approaches

** Non-goals
- produce anything that is usable for real data science 

** WIP Introduction to Statistical Learning

Freely available [[http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/][online]], based on [[https://www.r-project.org/][R]]. My goal is to work through the entire book,
reproducing the results of the learning algorithms as closely as possible.
